  <description>1.22.0.0 (09-25-2020)
This is a rehost of Jecrells orginal Vampires mod. I have not touched much outside of updating this to 1.2 and fixing the most obvious bugs.
In keeping in spirit with the original, I have added this as a new version, however.

Because of the way package IDs work for Rimworld mods, anything depending on the original Vampires mod will show a missing dependency.
The mods should still work though, as long as this is loaded BEFORE anything that depends on Vampires.

Requires JecsTools(Unofficial) for 1.2 or newer: [url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/2195729899]steam://url/CommunityFilePage/2195729899[/url]
Technically the normal JecsTools should work too, though they have not been updated from 1.1.
